                <h2>HIV/AIDS</h2>
                <p>
                    Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). 
                    HIV damages the immune system, making the body less able to fight infections and diseases. If left untreated, 
                    HIV can take years to weaken the immune system enough to develop AIDS. Fortunately, with treatment, most people 
                    in the U.S. do not progress to AIDS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    HIV is transmitted through contact with genitals during unprotected sex (a sexually transmitted infection, STI) 
                    and through blood when sharing needles or syringes. An untreated HIV-positive person can also transmit the virus 
                    to a child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there is no cure for HIV/AIDS, medications can control the infection and prevent the disease from progressing. 
                    Antiviral treatments have significantly reduced AIDS-related deaths worldwide, with ongoing efforts to improve access 
                    to prevention and treatment in resource-poor countries.
                </p>

                <h3>Causes and Transmission</h3>
                <p>
                    HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. 
                    Key transmission methods include unprotected sex, sharing needles, and mother-to-child transmission during birth or breastfeeding.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Stages of HIV Infection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Acute HIV Infection:</b> Occurs 2-4 weeks after infection with symptoms like fever, sore throat, and fatigue. This phase is highly contagious.</li>
                    <li><b>Clinical Latency:</b> Also known as the chronic phase, where HIV is active but reproduces at low levels. Without treatment, this stage can last a decade or longer.</li>
                    <li><b>AIDS:</b> The most severe stage, where the immune system is heavily damaged, leading to a high vulnerability to infections and certain cancers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Prevention Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    To reduce the risk of HIV infection, it is recommended to use protection during sexual activity, avoid sharing needles, and consider pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) medication for high-risk individuals. Regular testing and prompt treatment for HIV also play a crucial role in prevention.
                </p>

                <h3>Symptoms</h3>
                <p>
                    The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary based on the individual and the infection phase. 
                    During the primary infection stage, some people may experience flu-like symptoms 2 to 4 weeks after contracting 
                    the virus. This acute HIV stage can last a few days to several weeks, with some individuals showing no symptoms.
                </p>

                <h3>Treatment and Global Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the primary treatment for HIV, helping to suppress viral replication, maintain immune function, and reduce transmission. Access to ART has transformed HIV/AIDS from a fatal disease to a manageable chronic condition for many.
                    Despite advancements, HIV/AIDS remains a significant global health issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. 
                    Efforts continue globally to enhance prevention, treatment, and support for those affected by HIV/AIDS.

            <h2>Global HIV/AIDS Statistics (2023)</h2>
            <p>
                As of 2023, approximately <strong>39.9 million people</strong> are living with HIV worldwide. This includes 38.6 million adults and 1.4 million children under the age of 15. Around <strong>53% of those affected</strong> are women and girls.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were <strong>1.3 million new HIV infections</strong> globally in 2023, marking a 39% reduction in new infections since 2010. However, women and girls still accounted for 44% of these new cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The global treatment response has significantly improved, with <strong>77% of people with HIV</strong> now receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART), helping to manage the disease and reduce transmission. ART has been crucial in improving life expectancy for those infected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The concept of "undetectable = untransmittable" (U=U) has become a key message in the fight against HIV. People with HIV who maintain an undetectable viral load through ART cannot transmit the virus to HIV-negative partners during sex.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite progress, there are still <strong>5.4 million people</strong> unaware of their HIV status, which underscores the need for ongoing testing, education, and treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Global efforts continue to focus on improving access to prevention, treatment, and care, especially in regions like sub-Saharan Africa, with the goal of achieving 95% treatment coverage by 2025.
