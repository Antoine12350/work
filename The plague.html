            <h2>HISTORY OF PLAGUE</h2>
            <P>In early April 2020, when COVID-19 was beginning to seem inescapable, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and psychologist Daniel Kahneman, a scholar of the way we make judgements, spoke to a New Yorker podcast.

                "This is an exponential event," he said. "That is, we see things doubling every two days, every three days, every four days, and people – certainly including myself – don’t seem to be able to think straight about exponential growth.”
                
                That the deaths of today represented infections of maybe four or five weeks ago, even as the infection rate was whizzing skywards on an exponential trajectory, was “beyond intuitive human comprehension. And that’s interesting: that we’re in a situation that we’re simply not equipped to understand.”
                
                At that time, the confirmed global death toll from COVID-19 stood at 80,000. This month, the official body-count stands at 5 million – a number understood to represent a major underestimate. Some credible analyses peg SARS-CoV-2 fatalities at closer to 17 million. This number places it firmly on the list of the deadliest pandemics in history, even though it has run for a far shorter time than others on the list.</P>
            <p>
                Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, primarily spread by fleas that infest small mammals. It led to devastating pandemics such as the Black Death.

            <h2>Symptoms</h2>
            <p>Bubonic plague is characterized by swollen lymph nodes, fever, chills, and headache. Septicemic and pneumonic plague forms are more severe.</p>

            <h2>Prevention</h2>
            <p>Prevention includes controlling rodent populations, using flea repellents, and maintaining good sanitation. Antibiotics are effective if administered early.</p>
