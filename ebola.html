            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease in humans caused by the Ebola virus. It spreads through direct contact with body fluids of infected individuals or contaminated objects.
            </p>
            <p>
              <h2>History of the disease</h2>  
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe disease caused by Ebola virus, a member of the filovirus family, which occurs in humans and other primates. The disease was identified in 1976, in almost simultaneous outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan (now South Sudan).

Between 1979 and 1994, no cases or outbreaks were detected. However, since 1994, outbreaks have been recognised with increasing frequency (see section 1.2 below).

Until 2014, outbreaks of EVD were primarily reported from remote villages close to tropical rainforests in Central and West Africa. Most confirmed cases were reported from the DRC, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Uganda. In 2014, an EVD outbreak was reported for the first time in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone). During this outbreak, which was ongoing between 2014 and 2016, there was intense transmission in urban areas, resulting in over 28,000 reported cases. Multiple countries including Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the UK and the US, reported imported EVD cases associated with this outbreak (see section 1.3 below).

There are 6 species of Ebola virus, 4 of which are known to cause disease in humans:

Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV)
Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV)
Tai Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) (formerly known as Ebola Ivory Coast)
Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV)
Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) is known to have caused severe illness in non-human primates, but not in humans. RESTV was first detected in 1989 in Reston, Virginia (US), in a colony of monkeys imported from the Philippines, and has subsequently caused outbreaks in non-human primates in Pennsylvania and Texas (US), and Sienna (Italy). Several research workers became infected with the virus during these outbreaks, but did not become ill. Investigations traced the source of the outbreaks to an export facility in the Philippines, but how the facility was contaminated was not determined. In 2008, RESTV was isolated from sick pigs in the Philippines. Several animal facility workers developed antibodies, but none reported any symptoms.

A sixth species of Ebola virus was discovered in bats in Sierra Leone in 2018 and named Bombali ebolavirus. It is not yet known if this species is pathogenic to humans.
