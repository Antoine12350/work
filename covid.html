                <p><strong>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)</strong> is a contagious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. The first case was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, quickly spreading globally and resulting in a pandemic.</p>

            <p><h2>HISTORY OF COVID-19</h2>
                Since March 2020, the world has reeled from the Covid-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. According to Johns Hopkins University & Medicine, there have been 177 million known cases and 3.8 million deaths worldwide.

                Covid-19 touches much more than just the medical world. It and responses to it have devastated economies around the world. But it also raised issues of free inquiry, truth, and trust. Have people in positions of power lied to us? Have they put us at undue risk?
                
                Did the coronavirus come from nature or from a lab experiment? The answer to that question suggests the best responses for individuals and governments to take to prevent a recurrence. If we are to have any hope of successfully preventing massive deaths and economic chaos in the future, we must understand the virus’s origin.
                
                Two Theories
                The two primary theories of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 are natural transmission from animals to humans, also called zoonotic transmission, and manipulation in a virus laboratory, most likely the Wuhan Institute of Virology, or WIV. Both theories have merit; neither has been proven or disproven.
                
                With every “crime” scene, evidence can be found. Someone saw or heard something suspicious. There are notes, data, emails, footprints, fingerprints, and DNA evidence. A dog barked. Or a dog that should have barked didn’t.
